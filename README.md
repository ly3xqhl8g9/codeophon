<br />


A `codeophon`, in the spirit of the [colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)), lists meta-features of a software project.

Why a new word, `codeophon`? `colophon` feels still too attached to the paper space, and the transition from `colophōn` \[`κολοφών`\] ([summit](https://www.etymonline.com/word/colophon#etymonline_v_15844)) to `codeophon` seemed easy and playful enough. `codophon` is also a variant, however `codeophon` retains fully the `code` aspect and also inserts a different melodicity in the word.

Conventionally, the `codeophon` is added at the end of the index text file of a project (e.g., the `README.md` file).



## Meta-features

The `codeophon` can list anything that is appropriate on a project basis, however a common `codeophon` could contain:

+ licensing: `<value>`
+ versioning: `<value>`
+ encoding: `<value>`
